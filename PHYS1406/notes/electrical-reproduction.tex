\section{Electrical reproduction of sound}

\bi
\i A basic understanding of electricity and magnetism is 
needed to describe the functioning of musical recording 
and reproduction equipment.

\i Here, we briefly describe electrical circuits (voltage, current,
resistance, power, $\cdots$) and also Faraday's law of induction, 
which underlies the operation of microphones and loudspeakers.

\subsection{Basic electricity}

\bi

\i When a voltage source (such as a battery) is connected to a 
load (such as a flashlight bulb) via a closed path (called a
circuit), an electrical current flows.

\i The voltage is denoted by $V$ and is measured in volt (V).
The load has a {\em resistance}, denoted by $R$, which is 
measured in Ohm ($\Omega$).
The current is denoted by $I$ and is measured in Amp\`ere or 
Amp (A).

\i For certain materials, $V$, $I$, and $R$ are related by 
%
\be
R=V/I\quad{\rm or,\ equivalently,}\quad 
V= IR
\ee
%
This is called {\em Ohm's law of electricity}, not to be confused
with {\em Ohm's law of hearing}, even though it's by the same guy.

\i For a battery, which has a {\em polarity} ($+$ and 
$-$ terminals), the current $I$ flows in only one direction, 
which we take to be from the $+$ terminal of the battery 
to the $-$ terminal.
This is called a {\em direct current} (DC) circuit.
(See the left-hand panel of Figure~\ref{f:circuits_DC_AC}.)
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{circuits_DC_AC}
\caption{Left: Direct current (DC) circuit, consisting
of a voltage source $V$ and load having resistance $R$.
Right: Alternating current (AC) circuit, consisting of
a voltage source $V$ and load having impedance $Z$.
For a DC circuit, the current $I$ flows in only one direction.
For an AC circuit, the current $I$ flows alternately clockwise and
counterclockwise around the circuit.
(Figures from ``PHYS 1406: Physics of Sound \& Music" 
Course Guide by Prof.~Borst.)}
\label{f:circuits_DC_AC}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\i For a household wall outlet, the voltage $V$ alternates
sinusoidally with time (60~cycle/sec or 60~Hz), 
producing a current $I$ that 
also alternates sinusoidally, traveling both clockwise and 
counterclockwise around the circuit.
Such a circuit is called an {\em alternating current} (AC) circuit.
(See the right-hand panel of Figure~\ref{f:circuits_DC_AC}.)

\i For AC circuits, there is a relation 
%
\be
V = I Z
\ee
%
which is similar to Ohm's law, but it involves the {\em impedance}
$Z$ of the load.

\i Impedance is basically a generalization of resistance, which holds
for electrical devices such as {\em capacitors} (closely-spaced metal 
plates, which store electric charge) and {\em inductors} (coils of wire, 
which store electric currents).

\i The product 
%
\be
P = VI
\ee
%
is the electrical {\em power} associated with a circuit.
(For AC circuits, the formula is slightly more complicated than this,
due to the difference between resistance and impedance.)
Power is measured in Watt (W), such as that for a 100-W light bulb.

\i \exer
Using Ohm's law $V=IR$, show that
%
\be
P=VI=I^2 R = V^2/R
\ee

\i In general, power is the rate at which {\em work} (or {\em energy})
is  being done. 
If we denote the work (or energy) by $W$, which is done in 
time interval $\Delta t$, then
%
\be
P = W/\Delta t
\quad{\rm or,\ equivalently,}\quad
W = P\,\Delta t
\ee
%
Work (or energy) is measured in Joules (J), where 
$1~{\rm Watt} \equiv 1~{\rm Joule/sec}$.

\i \underline{Application}: 
A kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a convenient unit of 
energy that you will see on electric bills.
In terms of Joules
%
\be
1~{\rm kWh}
= 1~{\rm kW}\times 1~{\rm hr}
= 1000~{\rm W} \times 3600~{\rm s}
= 1000~{\rm J/s} \times 3600~{\rm s}
= 3.6\times 10^6~{\rm J}
\ee

\i \exer 
Suppose that you paid \$100 for last month's electrical bill
at a cost of \$0.13 per kWh.
(a) How many kWh did you use? 
(b) What was the average power consumption (in Watt) over 
the month (assume 30~days).

\i \ans

(a) 
\be 
W=\$100 \div \$0.13/{\rm kWh} = 769~{\rm kWh}
\ee 

(b)
\be
P = \frac{W}{\Delta t} 
= \frac{769~{\rm kWh}}{30\times 24~{\rm h}} 
= 1.1~{\rm kW} 
= 1,100~{\rm W}
\ee

This is equivalent to having eleven 100-W light bulbs 
on continuously for a month.

\subsection{Faraday's law}

\bi

\i In  1831, British scientist Michael Faraday discovered 
that a change in the magnetic flux through a coil of wire 
induces a voltage in the coil.
This is called {\em Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.}

\i Mathematically, the induced voltage is given by
%
\be
V = - N\,\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}
\ee
%
where $N$ is the number of loops of the coil and $\Delta\Phi$ 
is the change in the magnetic flux 
passing through a loop in time interval $\Delta t$.

\i \demo
Connect a coil of wire to a galvanometer (a sensitive current meter).
Move a permanent magnet toward or away from the coil and watch how the
galvanometer needle deflects.
Repeat, but keep the magnet stationary and move the coil instead.
Note that only the {\em relative} motion of the magnet and coil is important.
(See Figure~\ref{f:faraday}.)
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{faraday}
\caption{Illustration of Faraday's law.
As a magnetic moves back and forth ($X$ vs $t$) in the vicinty 
of a coil of wire, an alternating voltage ($V$ vs $t$) is induced
in the coil.
(Figure from ``Physics of Sound," by Berg and Stork.)} 
\label{f:faraday}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
 
\i Faraday's law of induction has had a profound influence of 
technology, as it underlies the operation of electric motors and generators.
It also underlies the operation of certain types of microphones and
loudspeakers (next subsection).

\i \underline{Demonstrations}:

(i)  Illustrate how a hand-powered AC generator works.

(ii) Illustrate the operation of a simple DC motor constructed
from electromagnets.

(iii) Show a ``do-it-yourself" DC motor constructed from a D-cell
flashlight battery, a small magnet, paper clips, and a coil of (magnet)
wire stripped on one side.

\i Note that electric motors and electric generators are basically 
``inverses" of one another:

For a generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy
by physically rotating a coil in an external magnetic field. 
An voltage is induced in the coil by Faraday's law.

For a motor, electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy 
by sending a current through a coil of wire.  
This current creates an electromagnet, which interacts with the 
external magnetic field, causing the coil to rotate.

\subsection{Microphones and loudspeakers}

\bi

\i Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction also underlies the
operation of so-called ``dynamic" microphones and loudspeakers.

\i A schematic diagram of a dynamic microphone is shown in 
Figure~\ref{f:microphone}.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{microphone}
\caption{Schematic diagram of a dynamics microphone.
The pressure deviation associated with a sound wave
pushes back and forth on the diaphragm of the microphone.
A coil of wire, which is attached to the diaphragm, thus
moves in the presence of a magnetic field.
The changing magnetic flux through the coil induces a voltage $V$ in
the coil which follows the fluctuations of the sound wave.
(Figure from ``Physics of Sound," by Berg and Stork.)} 
\label{f:microphone}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i When a sound wave impinges on the movable diaphragm, 
the pressure deviations in the wave cause the diaphragm 
to move back-and-forth in response to the sound.
A coil of wire, which is attached to the diaphragm, thus 
moves with respect to a fixed magnetic field, inducing a
time-varying voltage $V$ in the coil that follows the pressure
deviations in the sound wave.
This voltage can then be amplified and used as input 
to other electronics that can record or transmit the sound. 

\i A loudspeaker works like a microphone in reverse.

\caption{An electrical signal applied to the coil 
creates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the
permanent magnetic.
The speaker cone, which is attached to the coil, 
moves back-and-forth in repsonse to this interaction,
thus producing a sound wave.
