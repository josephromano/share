\section{Musical scales and tuning systems}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Terminology and equal temperament}
\bi

\item An International Conference in London 
in 1939 established
A$_4$ = 440~Hz as the standard reference frequency.
Before that time, A$_4$ was tuned to different
frequencies ranging from 422.5~Hz (Handel) to
444~Hz, depending on composer, orchestra, ...

\item Scale: succession of notes in ascending or
descending order.

\item Different scales correspond to different
divisions of the octave---chromatic (12 intervals),
diatonic (7 intervals), 
pentatonic (5 intervals). 

\i For example, 
a chromatic scale divides the octave into 
12 intervals called {\em semitones} or {\em half-steps}.
In {\em equal temperament} tuning, 
these intervals all have
the same size, corresponding to a frequency ratio of 
%
\be
2^{1/12} = 1.05946
\ee
%
A {\em whole tone} is exactly equal to two semitones.

\i Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei)
and Chu Tsai-Yu (a Chinese scholar) independently
proposed an equal-tempered chromatic scale around 1580.

\i But equal-tempered tuning didn't become popular 
until the 1700's.
``The Well-Tempered Clavier" by Johannes Sebastian Bach 
demonstrated the usefulness of equal-temperament.
Using all 24 major and minor keys, this piece sounded
good only in equal-tempered tuning, and not in the other
tuning systems that we will describe below.

\i A {\em cent} is a frequency interval equal to
1/100 of a semitone in equal temperament.
This corresponds to a frequency ratio of
%
\be
2^{1/1200} = 1.000578
\ee
%

\i The human ear can distinguish frequencies
that differ by about 10 cents, which corresponds to 
a frequency ratio of $2^{10/1200}=1.00579$, 
or about a 0.5\% difference in frequency.
(We will discuss this in more detail in a later
section when we talk about {\em just noticeable
difference} for pitch.)

\i Table~\ref{t:equal-temperament} gives the frequency
ratios for a chromatic scale in equal-temperament tuning.
%
\begin{table}[htbp]

corresponding equal-temperament frequency ratios.}

\i Figure~\ref{f:chromatic-scale-keyboard} shows the
corresponding notes on a piano keyboard.

\i A full piano keyboard, which has 88 keys 
ranging from A$_0$ to C$_8$, 
is a basically a logarithmic
frequency scale, with neighboring keys 
(white-black or white-white) corresponding
to a frequency interval of a semitone.

\i On a piano, or any instrument tuned to
equal temperament, the sharps and flats are equal
to one another---e.g., C${}^\sharp$ and D${}^\flat$
are tuned to the same frequency.
These are called {\em enharmonic} notes.

\i NOTE!! This equality of sharps and flats is
{\em not} true, in general, for other tuning systems
such as Pythagorean, mean-tone, or just temperament 
(see below).
For these systems, one must first decide to tune,
for example, to C$^\sharp$ or D$^\flat$, etc., and 
{\em then} set the other (enharmonic) note equal to the first.

\i It is common to choose:
% 
\be
{\rm C}-{\rm C}^\sharp-{\rm D}-{\rm E}^\flat-{\rm E}-%
{\rm F}-{\rm F}^\sharp-{\rm G}-{\rm A}^\flat-{\rm A}-%
{\rm B}^\flat-{\rm B}-{\rm C}'
\nonumber
\ee
%
as the fundamental notes in a chromatic scale.

\i Figure~\ref{f:musical-staves-log-scale}
shows the correspondence between the treble and bass 
staves and their equal-tempered frequencies.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]

staves and their equal-tempered frequencies.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
This is another example of a logarithmic frequency
scale.

\i The staff lines are not equally-spaced
in this graph, since some divisions correspond to a 
minor third (three semitones), while other divisions
correspond to a major third (four semitones).

\i \exer 
Show that middle C in equal temperament has a frequency
of $261.63~{\rm Hz}$:
%
\be
{\rm C}_4:\quad 
{\rm A}_3 \cdot 2^{3/12} =
\frac{440\ {\rm Hz}}{2}\cdot 2^{3/12} = 261.63~{\rm Hz}
\ee

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Diatonic scales}
\bi

\i A diatonic scale divides the octave into 
7 intervals consisting of both tones and semitones.
The order of tones and semitones 
defines the {\em major} interval order, 
{\em minor} interval order, and various 
{\em modes} (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, ...)
as shown in Figure~\ref{f:diatonic-interval-order}.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Interval orders for a diatonic scale:
major, minor, and various modes.}
\label{f:diatonic-interval-order}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i The diatonic major interval order is 
T-T-S-T-T-T-S (2-2-1-2-2-2-1).
This is the standard
%
\be
{\rm do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do}

%
interval order.

\i The diatonic minor interval order is
T-S-T-T-S-T-T (2-1-2-2-1-2-2).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Musical intervals}
\bi

\i Table~\ref{t:musical-intervals} is a list 
of the most common musical intervals and their 
corresponding {\em just} and 
equal-tempered frequency ratios.  
(We will discuss the just temperament
tuning system in detail in a later subsection.)

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Interval & \# semitones & Just freq ratio &
ET freq ratio & Difference (cents) & Example \\
\hline
Octave & 12 & $2:1=2.000$ & 2.000 & 0 & C-C$'$ \\
Perfect fifth & 7 & $3:2=1.500$ & 1.498 & 2 & C-G \\
Perfect fourth & 5 & $4:3=1.333$ & 1.335 & $-2$ & C-F, G-C$'$ \\
Major third & 4 & $5:4=1.250$ & 1.260 & $-14$ & C-E \\
Minor third & 3 & $6:5=1.200$ & 1.189 & 16 & C-E${}^\flat$, A-C$'$ \\
Minor sixth & 8 & $8:5=1.600$ & 1.587 & 14 & C-A${}^\flat$, E-C$'$ \\
Major sixth & 9 & $5:3=1.667$ & 1.682 & $-16$ & C-A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Common musical intervals and their corresponding
just and equal-tempered frequency ratios.}
\label{t:musical-intervals}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\i A musical interval corresponds to a 
{\em ratio} of frequencies.
Multiplication of frequency ratios corresponds
to addition of frequency intervals.

\i For example,
an octave equals a perfect fifth plus a perfect fourth,
or a major third plus a minor sixth, 
or a minor third plus a major sixth:
%
\be
\frac{3}{2}\cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{1}\,,
\quad
\frac{5}{4}\cdot \frac{8}{5} = \frac{2}{1}\,,
\quad
\frac{6}{5}\cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{2}{1}
\ee
%

\i Also, a perfect fifth equals a major third plus a minor third:
%
\be
\frac{5}{4}\cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{3}{2}
\ee
%

\i Notes in a harmonic series have frequencies that 
are integer multiples of some fundamental frequency:
$f_n= n f_1$, where $n=1,2,\cdots$.
Successive harmonics can be related to the musical 
intervals as shown in Figure~\ref{f:harmonics-keys},
where the fundamental frequency corresponds to A$_2$.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{harmonics-keys}
\caption{Notes on a piano keyboard corresponding to
the first eight harmonics of A$_2$.}
\label{f:harmonics-keys}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i A comparison of the harmonic frequencies and
equal-tempered frequenices are given in 
Table~\ref{t:harmonics-ET}.
%
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Harmonic & Exact freq (Hz) & Equal-tempered freq (Hz) 
& Difference (cents) & Piano note \\ 
\hline
1 & 110 & 110.00 & 0 & A$_2$ \\
2 & 220 & 220.00 & 0 & A$_3$ \\
3 & 330 & 329.63 & 2 & E$_4$ \\
4 & 440 & 440.00 & 0 & A$_4$ \\
5 & 550 & 554.37 & $-14$ & C$_5^\sharp$ \\
6 & 660 & 659.26 & 2 & E$_5$ \\
7 & 770 & 783.99 & $-31$ & G$_5$ \\
8 & 880 & 880.00 & 0 & A$_5$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Relation between harmonic frequencies
and equal-tempered frequencies.}
\label{t:harmonics-ET}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\i Chords: There are three major chords (triads) 
having just frequency ratios 4:5:6:
%
\be
{\rm C-E-G}\,,
\quad
{\rm F-A-C}\,,
\quad
{\rm G-B-D}
\nonumber
\ee
%
These three notes correspond to a major third followed by a minor third.

\i There are two minor chords (triads) 
having just frequency ratios 10:12:15:
%
\be
{\rm E-G-B}\,,
\quad
{\rm A-C-E}
\nonumber
\ee
%
These three notes correspond to a minor third followed by a major third.

\i A useful construct is the so-called {\em circle of fifths}
shown in Figure~\ref{f:circle-of-fifths}.
Successive notes on the circle are separated by a musical fifth.
Clockwise motion around the outer part of the circle 
corresponds to going up by fifths;
counter-clockwise motion around the inner part of the circle
corresponds to going down by fifths.
In equal temperament, the notes next to one another have the 
same frequency; 
this is not the case for other tuning systems such as Pythagorean,
mean-tone, or just temperament.
For these other tuning systems, the circle of fifths does {\em not}
close.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]

valid for equal temperament tuning
is shown in Figure~\ref{f:circle-of-fifths-simple}.

\subsection{Major and minor key signatures}
\bi

\i Major and minor key signatures can be read off a 
circle-of-fifths diagram if we draw appropriate `wedges'
on the diagram as shown in Figure~\ref{f:major-minor-keys}.
(The diagram for major key scales is shown on the left;
the diagram for minor key scales is shown on the right.)
Simply `dial the wedge' so that that the numeral I points
to the tonic.  
Subsequent keys in the scale are given by numerals II, III, ...
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{major-keys} &
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{minor-keys} 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Diagrams for reading off major and minor key scales
(left panel and right panel, respectively).
`Dial the wedge' so that the numeral I points to the tonic.}
\label{f:major-minor-keys}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i For example, the C-major and C-minor diatonic scales are:
\be
{\rm C-D-E-F-G-A-B}
\nonumber
\ee
% 
and
%
\be
{\rm C-D-E}^\flat{\rm -F-G-G}^\sharp{\rm -A}^\sharp
\nonumber
\ee

\i The notes in the G-major scale are the same as for C-major 
except for F$^\sharp$:
%
\be
{\rm G-A-B-C-D-E-F}^\sharp
\nonumber
\ee
% 

\i The notes in the F-major scale are the same as for C-major 
except for B$^\flat$:
%
\be
{\rm F-G-A-B}^\flat{\rm -C-D-E}
\nonumber
\ee
% 

\i In general, moving clockwise around the circle of fifths
increases the number of sharps in the key signature by one.
Moving counter-clockwise around the circle of fifths increases
the number of flats in the key signature by one.

\i Note that the A-minor scale is
%
\be
{\rm A-B-C-D-E-F-G}
\nonumber
\ee
% 
so the notes are {\em exactly} the same as for C-major.
But because the tonic (and tonal interval order) are 
different for these two scales, they sound differently.

\ei
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pentatonic scales}
\bi

\i A pentatonic scale is probably the oldest 
division of the octave.
It was developed independently in many different cultures.

\i A pentatonic scale divides the octave into
5 intervals (3 intervals are whole tones and
2 intervals are three semitones wide).

\i A pentatonic scale can be constructed from 
just fifths and the octave 
(or, equivalently, from just fifths and fourths)
as a subset of Pythagorean temperament (see
next subsection).

\i A guitar (or any 6-string instrument) can be tuned 
to a pentatonic scale {\em using only the guitar to do
the tuning} as described below:

[To play a note {\em an octave above} an open note, touch the 
string at its half-way point (12th fret on a guitar) 
as you pluck it with your other hand.
Similarly, to play a note {\em a fifth above} an open note, 
touch the string at its one-third point (7th fret on a guitar)
as you pluck it with your other hand.]

Instructions (tuning order: string 6 (top), 1 (bottom), 3, 5, 2, 4):

- Adjust the tension of string 6 
to any value that gives it a nice sound (let us assume it's a C)

- Tune the open note of string 1 
to the note an octave above string 6 (then string 1 will be C$'$)

- Tune the open note of string 3 to the note 
a fifth above string 6 (then string 3 will be G)

- Tune the note an octave above string 5 to the note
a fifth above string 3 (then string 5 will be D)

- Tune the open note of string 2 to the note 
a fifth above string 5 (then string 2 will be A)

- Tune the note an octave above string 4 to the note
a fifth above string 2 (then string 4 will be E)

The result is the guitar tuned to the pentatonic
scale in major interval order 2-2-3-2-3;
for this example, it is the key of C corresponding to 
the notes C-D-E-G-A-C$'$.

\item
The pentatonic scale also has minor
and various modal inteval orders.
The major interval order is: 2-2-3-2-3.
The minor interval order is: 3-2-2-3-2.
(See Figure~\ref{f:pentatonic-interval-order}.)

\caption{Interval orders for a pentatonic scale:
major, minor, and various modes.}
\label{f:pentatonic-interval-order}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i Examples of pentatonic scales in major interval
order are C-D-E-G-A-C$'$ and
F${}^\sharp$-G${}^\sharp$-A${}^\sharp$-C${}^\sharp$-D${}^\sharp$-F$'{}^\sharp$
(the black keys on a piano).

\i Note that both
C-D-F-G-A-C$'$ and
the 
C$^\sharp$-D$^\sharp$-F$^\sharp$-G$^\sharp$-A$^\sharp$-C$'{}^\sharp$
are pentatonic scales with modal tonal structure: 2-3-2-2-3.

\i \demo
Examples of music played using a pentatonic scale are
``Amazing Grace," 
``Auld Lang Syne," 
``My Girl" (by the Temptations), and
Etude Op.10 No.5 (Black Keys) by Chopin.

\subsection{Pythagorean temperament}
\bi

\i Pythagorean temperament is a tuning system 
scale constructed from just fifths and the the octave
(or, equivalently, from just fifths and fourths).

\i Using the circle of fifths, we can tune
a chromatic scale to Pythagorean
temperament as illustrated in Figure~\ref{f:pythagorean-chromatic-scale}.

\caption{A portion of the circle of fifths 
for calculating a chromatic scale of frequencies in Pythagorean temperament.}
\label{f:pythagorean-chromatic-scale}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\i Applying the appropriate number of factors of $3/2$ 
(or $2/3$) and then scaling by $1/2$ (or $2$) 
to bring the resulting frequency to within an octave
of C, we obtain the numbers
in Table~\ref{t:pythagorean-chromatic}.

\label{t:pyth_vs_ET}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\i Note that the circle of fifths doesn't close since
B$^\sharp$ and C$'$ are not equal to one another.
In addition, C$^\sharp$ doesn't equal D$^\flat$,
C$^\flat$ doesn't equal B, B$^{\flat\flat}$ doesn't equal A,
etc.

\i Pythagorean comma: ratio of frequencies for B$^\sharp$
and C$'$:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm B}^\sharp}{{\rm C}'}
= \frac{(3/2)^{12} (1/2)^6}{2/1} 
= \frac{(3/2)^{12}}{2^7}
= \frac{531441}{524288} 
= 1.0136
\end{equation}
%

\i The above is equivalent to the statement that 
12 fifths doesn't exactly equal 7 octaves.
They differ by a ratio of 1.0136, which corresponds to
an interval of 23 cents.

\i Pythagorean temperament (by construction)
has perfect fourths and fifths in the key of C, 
but in the key of C$^\sharp$, the
fifth from C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ 
is too flat by a factor of the Pythagorean comma:
%
\be
\frac{{\rm A}^\flat / {\rm C}^\sharp}{3/2}=
\frac{(128/81)/(2187/2048)}{3/2}
= \frac{1}{1.0136}
\ee
%
This is called a {\em wolf fifth} due to its `howling' sound
(which I can't hear!).

\i \demo
Use the matlab routine playinterval.m to compare the 
fifths C to G and C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ in 
Pythagorean temperament.

\i In addition, a Pythagorean third (e.g., from C to E)
differs signicantly 
from a just major third that has a frequency ratio of 5/4.
This difference is called the {\em syntonic comma}:
%
\begin{equation}
\delta
=\frac{81/64}{5/4} 
=\frac{81}{80}
= 1.0125

Thus, a Pythagorean third is too sharp by just over 
1\% or approximately 22 cents.

\subsection{Mean-tone temperament}
\bi

\i Mean-tone temperament (or {\em quarter-comma mean-tone 
temperament}) is a tuning system that tries to correct the
problem with Pythagorean major thirds by flattening them with 
the syntonic comma $\delta$.

\i This flattening of a Pythagorean third is accomplished by
flattening the fifths by one-quarter of the syntonic comma.
This is called a {\em diminished fifth} and has a frequency
ratio:
%
\be
\frac{3}{2}\delta^{-1/4} = 
\frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{81}{80}\right)^{-1/4}
= 1.4953
\ee
%

\i Using a diminished fifth in place of a just fifth,
the construction of the mean-tone chromatic scale
is identical to that for the Pythagorean chromatic scale,
as shown in Figure~\ref{f:mean-chromatic-scale}.

\i The major thirds (C to E, F to A, and G to B) 
have been flattened by the syntonic comma $\delta$ so that
they now have the just frequency ratio of 5:4.

\i All the major seconds (i.e., whole tone intervals
C to D, D to E, F to G, etc.)
have been flattened by $\delta/2$ so they now have a
frequency ratio of $\sqrt{5}:2 = 1.118$, instead of
$9:8 = 1.1250$ in Pythagorean temperament.

\i If one goes all away around the circle of fifths
using diminished fifths, one finds that the circle
doesn't close by $-41$~cents.
(In other words, 12 diminished fifths is short of 
7 octaves by an interval of 41 cents.)

\i For comparison, for Pythagorean temperament, 
the circle of fifths also doesn't close, 
overshooting by $23$~cents.

\i Similar to Pythagorean temperament, the fifth
from C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ is out of tune.
It differs from a perfect fifth by 36~cents,
which is more than the difference for Pythagorean
tuning, which was $-23$~cents.

\subsection{Just temperament}
\bi

\i Just temperament is a tuning system constructed 
from perfect fifths, major thirds, and the octave 
(or, equivalently, from perfect fifths, perfect fourths,
major thirds, and minor sixths).
In the key of C-major, it has three beatless 
major chords and two beatless minor chords.

\i Using Figure~\ref{f:just-chromatic-scale} as a schematic
for going up and down in frequency by perfect fifths and 
major thirds, we obtain the frequency ratios given in
Table~\ref{t:just-chromatic}.

\i Just temperament is arguably the best possible tuning 
system, provided one stays within the key in which 
you tuned to, e.g., the key of C for the above tuning.

\i But just as we saw for Pythagorean and mean-tone 
temperament, just temperament becomes increasingly out 
of tune as one move away from the key of C.
For example, the fifth C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ in the
key of C$^\sharp$ differs from a perfect fifth by 41~cents.

\subsection{Comparison of different tuning systems}

\i Figure~\ref{f:comparetemperaments} compares
the frequency ratios for a chromatic scale for
the four different tuning systems that we considered
in the previous subsections.

One can easily see from this figure
that the perfect fifth C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ is too flat in
Pythagorean tuning and too sharp in mean-tone and just temperament
tuning.
 
\i Table~\ref{t:fifths} quantifies this comparison, 
giving the frequency ratios of two different fifths
(C to G and C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$) in the four different
tuning systems that we considered.

these frequency ratios and 3/2 for a just perfect fifth.

\i \demo
Use the matlab routine fifths.m to compare the two
different fifths, C to G and C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$,
in the four different tuning systems that we considered.

\i There is no perfect tuning system.
Each system makes some compromise:

i) Equal temperament: Music in equal temperament 
can be played equally-well in all keys at the expense of 
imperfect intervals in all keys---e.g., a perfect 
fifth doesn't have a frequency
ratio of 3/2, a major third doesn't have a frequency
ratio of 5/4, etc.
The circle of fifths closes.

ii) Pythagorean tuning has just perfect fifths
in the key of C, but major thirds that 
are sharper than just major thirds by the 
syntonic comma $\delta = 1.0125$ (22 cents)
even in the key of C.
This means that major chords like 
C-E-G sound out of tune.
Also, even perfect fifths are no longer 
just perfect fifths when one moves away from the 
key of C---e.g., the wolf fifth 
C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ is 23 cents too flat.

iii) Mean-tone tuning modifies Pythagorean tuning
so that it has just major thirds (ratio 5/4) 
in the key of C, at the expense of having 
perfect fifths that are a quarter-comma (5 cents)
too flat.
So the major chords like C-E-G sound better in
mean-tone tuning than in Pythagorean tuning, 
at least in the key of C.
But as before, things get worse as one moves 
away from the key of C---e.g., the perfect fifth
C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ is now 36 cents too sharp.

iv) Just temperament is the ideal tuning system
in the key of C having perfect fifths and major
thirds with frequency ratios of 3/2 and 5/4, 
respectively.
But just like Pythagorean and mean-tone tuning,
just temperament gets progressively worse as one 
moves away from the key of C---e.g., the perfect
fifth C$^\sharp$ to A$^\flat$ is now 41 cents too sharp.
