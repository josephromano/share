\i What is the main difference between a harp and a guitar?

\i The natural frequencies of the standing wave vibrations
on a string depend on three things.
What are they?

\i Calculate the fundamental frequency for a guitar string
having a length of 60~cm, a mass of 2 gm, subject to a 
tension of 50 pounds.
(Hint: Convert cm to m, gm to kg and pounds
to Newtons before substituting into the formula for the frequency.)

\i Do the harmonics of a plucked string depend on the 
location of plucking?

\i Suppose you pluck a guitar string 1/5th of the way from
the bridge.
What harmonics will be absent?

\i Why are the YouTube videos showing oscillations of a guitar
string captured with an iPhone somewhat misleading about wave 
propagation on a vibrating string?

\i Explain how a violin bow excites vibrations in a violin string.

\i Do the harmonics of a bowed string depend on the location 
of bowing?
(Assume that the bow is very narrow.)

\i Why are the strings of a string instrument usually connected 
to a box-shaped object?

\i Why wouldn't a violin finger board work if it was on a guitar?
