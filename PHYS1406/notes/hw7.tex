\i (a) Explain the difference between just noticeable
difference for pitch and 
the limit of frequency discrimination.
(b) Calculate both of these values at a center frequency of
1000~Hz.

\i Compare and contrast the place theory of pitch 
perception and the periodicity theory of pitch perception.
 
\i (a) What is the missing fundamental frequency for the
harmonics 220~Hz, 330~Hz, 440~Hz, etc.
(b) Does the missing fundamental frequency correspond
to a real physical wave in the ear?

\i What is responsible for the production of aural harmonics?
Do they correspond to real physical waves in the ear?

\i (a) What is the frequency of the difference tone 
associated with C${}_4$ and G${}_4$?
(b) What note does this correspond to?

\i Describe Ohm's law of hearing and why it is important
for sound reproduction systems.

\i Give an example of two frequencies that would produce
(a) first-order beats and (b) second-order beats.
What are the beat frequencies for each?

\i What is an attack transient and how does it affect the
timbre of a sound?
Give an example.

\i Do two notes a perfect fifth apart always sound consonant?
If not, explain in what circumstances the notes would sound
dissonant.

\i What is the difference between pitch height and pitch class?
