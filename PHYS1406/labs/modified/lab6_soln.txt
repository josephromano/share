Lab 6 solutions

Part I
------
1) The amplitudes of the higher harmonics are greater for the violin
than the guitar.

2) The spacing between the harmonics would increase if the pitch is
increased.  The number of contributing harmonics would be similar.

3) A bowed violin string would have more harmonics, with most of the
contribution to the sound coming from the higher harmonics.

4) 2093 Hz/196 Hz ~ 10 which is between 3 and 4 octaves (factor of 8
and 16)

Part II
-------
1) The frequency spectrum of the slide whistle is dominated by the
fundamental.

2) If you overblow the lowest note, you would see contributions from
the 3rd and (maybe) 5th harmonics (only odd harmonics because the tube
is closed at one end).

Part III
--------
1) f = v/4L, v=346 m/s, L=0.17 m -> f = 509 Hz ~ 500 Hz
Next three harmonics: 1500, 2500, 3500 Hz

2) Male: formant regions around 200, 1000, 1700 Hz.  
Female:  formant regions around 200, 1200, 2000 Hz
These formant regions are located around similar frequencies.

3) To change the resonant frequencies of the formant regions you
should change the position of your jaw, tongue, lips.  To change the
frequency of the vocal folds, you need to change the tension in the
vocal folds.

4) 300-3000 Hz is sufficient for telephones since the typical
frequency range of speech lies in this band.
